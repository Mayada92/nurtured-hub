**Educational Data Science Application**

Developed a machine learning model to predict chronic absenteeism in students, enabling early identification of at-risk students and supporting intervention strategies to improve educational outcomes.

This project was presented as a conference poster at UC Berkeley, showcasing the application of machine learning techniques to educational data science challenges.

## Project Overview

This educational data science project applies machine learning techniques to predict which students are at risk of chronic absenteeism. By identifying these students early, schools and educators can implement targeted interventions to improve attendance and educational outcomes.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Modeling**: ML models to identify students at risk of chronic absenteeism
- **Early Intervention Support**: Enables proactive measures before attendance becomes a critical issue
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Leverages educational data to inform decision-making
- **Student Support**: Focuses on supporting student success through predictive analytics

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning**: Predictive modeling algorithms
- **Educational Data Analytics**: Analysis of student attendance and performance data
- **Python**: Data processing and model development
- **Statistical Analysis**: Advanced statistical methods for educational research

## Impact

This project demonstrates the application of data science to educational challenges, showing how predictive analytics can support student success and help educators make data-informed decisions about student support.

## Applications

- Early identification of at-risk students
- Resource allocation for intervention programs
- Understanding factors contributing to absenteeism
- Supporting educational equity and student success

## Presentation

This project was presented as a conference poster at UC Berkeley, demonstrating the application of machine learning to predict chronic absenteeism in the Oakland Unified School District. The presentation highlighted key findings including attendance time trends, GPA-attendance correlations, and demographic patterns in chronic absenteeism.

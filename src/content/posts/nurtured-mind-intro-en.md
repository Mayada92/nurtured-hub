With **Nurtured Mind**, I believe that growth begins with curiosity and flourishes through reflection and discovery. This platform is a space where ideas take root, insights grow, and knowledge thrives.

## My Story

I'm Mayada Alhashem, and I also go by Maya — an engineer, data scientist, and lifelong learner with a passion for education, artificial intelligence, and human development. My journey spans fields as diverse as AI, psychology, and child development, all driven by a deep desire to make knowledge accessible and meaningful.

With in-progress master's in **Data Science** and graduate certificate in **Human Development and Learning**, I combine technical expertise with an understanding of human behavior to explore how technology can empower growth and learning. I'm also deeply invested in integrating cultural and ethical values into modern education.

**Smart Music Recommendation System for Emerging Artists (SMRSEA)**

Collaborated with UC Berkeley MIDS teammates to develop a graph-based music recommendation system that helps emerging artists gain visibility by prioritizing musical quality over popularity metrics.

## Project Overview

SMRSEA (Smart Music Recommendation System for Emerging Artists) is an innovative music discovery platform that uses graph databases and machine learning to connect listeners with emerging artists based on musical similarity and quality, rather than just popularity.

## Key Features

- **Graph-Based Discovery**: Leveraged Neo4j to create a graph database mapping relationships between artists, songs, and playlists
- **Data Engineering**: Processed 12.9M Spotify playlist entries using advanced data engineering techniques
- **Multi-Database Architecture**: Integrated Neo4j, MongoDB, and Redis for optimal performance
- **Quality-Focused Algorithms**: Implemented recommendation algorithms that prioritize musical quality and similarity over popularity metrics
- **Emerging Artist Support**: Designed specifically to help emerging artists gain visibility in a crowded music market

## Technologies Used

- **Neo4j**: Graph database for relationship mapping
- **MongoDB**: Document storage for playlist and track data
- **Redis**: Caching layer for performance optimization
- **Python**: Data processing and algorithm implementation
- **Spotify API**: Data source for 12.9M playlist entries

## Impact

This project demonstrates advanced data engineering skills and innovative thinking in recommendation systems, focusing on fairness and quality over traditional popularity-based metrics.

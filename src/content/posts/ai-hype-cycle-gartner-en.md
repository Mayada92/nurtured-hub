**How AI Fits into the Gartner Hype Cycle**

With all the AI madness, I think it's time to bring the Gartner Hype Cycle into the conversation, a framework that shows how innovations and technologies progress over time. It defines five stages, which depend not only on technical maturity and development but also on human psychology. And when they say **history repeats itself**, it often does the same way with hype.

## The Five Stages of the Hype Cycle

The first stage is the **Innovation Trigger**, a breakthrough, a research paper, or a product launch that starts the excitement. Then comes the **Peak of Inflated Expectations**, when excitement builds and people share news and predictions, often with unrealistic goals. After that comes the **Trough of Disillusionment**, when the masses realize the gap between expectations and reality. From there, we climb the **Slope of Enlightenment**, as people start to see realistic, practical uses. Finally, things level at the **Plateau of Productivity**, where the technology's value stabilizes.

## For Leaders and Decision-Makers

Hype Cycles are designed for leaders, executives, and decision-makers to help them plan investments, roadmaps, and budgets. They can't afford to blindly follow hype like the public. They need to avoid four traps: adopting too early, giving up too soon, adopting too late, or holding on for too long.

## Where Are We with AI?

But recent literature makes it clear that we are still racing toward the peak of inflated expectations with AI, and in many cases without financial wisdom, business alignment, or data readiness to support adoption.

### The Reality Check

A widely cited MIT Media Lab study found that **95% of organizations see no measurable return** from their generative AI investments, with most pilots stalling in exploratory phases without real business impact (Leidig et al., 2024).

Similarly, broader surveys show that **70–90% of enterprise AI initiatives fail to scale** past the pilot stage into operational use, which underscores how rare genuine commercialization is (Beam AI, 2023).

Experts also argue that many AI projects fail to deliver ROI because they lack clear KPIs, proper ROI tracking, and business context, something Gartner itself emphasizes in its frameworks for AI adoption (Masood, 2021).

A study of UK businesses found **no statistically significant increase in labor productivity** from AI adoption, suggesting that hype has outpaced real-world results (Valero & Van Reenen, 2023).

## The Foundation Matters

All of this reinforces the idea that data quality, domain expertise, and business context are just as critical as algorithms. Without these foundations, the ROI of AI is questionable. In some cases, I believe if you're not going to do it right, it might actually be better not to use AI at all.

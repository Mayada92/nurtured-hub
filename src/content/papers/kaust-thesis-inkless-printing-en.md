This master's thesis research project studied the patented idea of inkless black-and-white printing via paper pyrolysis with lasers. The work investigated the effect of varying laser power density, speed of moving the laser, and laser distance via UV-Vis absorption tests. The research contributed to the development of the Blazer Printer technology (US Patent 8,988,475 B2).

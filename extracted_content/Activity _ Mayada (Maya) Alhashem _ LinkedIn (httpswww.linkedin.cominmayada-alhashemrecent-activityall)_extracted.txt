After months of balancing work, studies, and life in general, I’m happy (and
honestly a little relieved 😅) to say I officially earned this certification!
This exam really tested my ML and MLOps knowledge, and to make it even
more challenging, it was Google Cloud Services (GCP)-specific (which I don't
use in my day-to-day). The certification covers:
• Designing end-to-end ML pipelines
• Deploying models with Vertex AI
• Handling big data with BigQuery and Dataflow
• Practicing Responsible AI 267 5 comments·43 reposts
• Thinking about real-world ML at scale and in production

This semester, I had the privilege of working on a meaningful data science
research project through the UC Berkeley Data Discovery Program. My host
organization, Oakland Natives Give Back, is a non-profit tackling the
pressing issue of chronic absenteeism—a challenge for both students and
school administrators, especially during and after COVID-19.
As a Data Science Intern, I collaborated with fellow UC Berkeley colleagues
to analyze student attendance data and uncover patterns in attendance
behaviors. The dataset spanned seven schools in Oakland Unified School
District over seven years, including attendance rates, GPA, and demographic
information. After conducting exploratory data analysis, we built machine
learning models to predict students at risk of chronic absenteeism in future
school years. Our work focused on Random Forest and XGBoost models,
both of which achieved approximately 80% accuracy, precision, and recall.
Looking ahead, we aim to enhance the models’ accuracy and develop a
system that identifies at-risk students on a daily basis rather than yearly. This
shift would allow for timelier and more effective interventions. Our goal is to
empower school faculty with data-driven tools to make impactful decisions
and promote educational equity.
This experience has been incredibly rewarding, not just for the project itself
but for the opportunity to work alongside an amazing team of peers and
mentors. I’m excited to see how our work continues to make a difference in
addressing chronic absenteeism and promoting equitable education
through technology.
I’d love to connect and discuss this work with anyone interested in data

Had the privilege to work with this talented young woman along with our team
of interns.
I'm glad UC Berkeley School of Information opened the door for me to be an
intern remotely (while still here in Saudi Arabia) with the rest of the team in the
US. This is part of an extraordinary program called Data Discovery.
We had the option to apply for data science projects with Berkeley's partners
and work as interns for credit. To me, it was an opportunity to hit two birds with
one stone, accelerate my development in the field of Data Science, and also use
the skills I have for greater good. Since I am passionate about education, I
applied for the projects related to schools. This one in particular addresses the
issue of Chronic Absenteeism.
Chronic absenteeism is missing 10% or more of school days in a given year. It
can significantly impact a student's academic performance, social connections,
and overall well-being.
Our team leveraged data science under Oakland Natives Give Back (ONGB) to
support schools address this critical challenge. By developing predictive models
and visualization tools, we aimed to help educators identify early warning signs
to implement timely interventions. The potential impact? Helping schools
support their students before attendance becomes a barrier to their success,
ultimately contributing to better educational outcomes and brighter futures for
students.
It was an honor and a pleasure working under Mani Grewal's supervision and 28 3 comments
mentorship of Raviraj Sonwalkar this semester. Many thanks to @Carren Gopez
for her continuous support to the interns. Looking forward to continue Like
serving ONGB to address the objectives of our project.

their widespread public benefits. This gap is deeply rooted in human psychology
and also the speed of human development.
Resistance to change, fear of the unknown, and societal inertia often slow down

As someone who is constantly looking to expand my skills and knowledge,
especially in the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence, this course
was a great step forward. Fuzzy logic has always intrigued me with its ability to
handle the uncertainty and vagueness in real-world scenarios, and now, I feel
confident in applying these concepts using Python.
This course covered everything from the fundamentals of fuzzy logic to practical
Python implementations, all in a concise 4.5-hour package. It was an eye-opener
and gave me new tools to approach complex decision-making problems in a
more nuanced and flexible way. I am excited to apply this knowledge to my
work with Artificial Lift and ESPs - a domain filled with uncertainties.
If you're curious about fuzzy logic or looking to sharpen your Python skills, I
highly recommend checking out this course. Learning never stops, and neither
should our curiosity! 🚀

Remember the Wright brothers and their revolutionary airplane? They drew

Enter Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) - a paradigm shift to bridge this gap.
From Rigid to Fluid
Researchers at MIT have developed neural networks that learn on the job, not
just during training. These "liquid" networks change their underlying equations
to continuously adapt to new data inputs [1].
Why "liquid"? Just as water shapes itself to its container, these networks mold
themselves to the data they encounter. This fluidity allows them to handle ever-
changing data streams with unprecedented grace.
Interestingly, inspiration came from an unlikely source- the microscopic
nematode, C. elegans. With just 302 neurons, this tiny creature generates
unexpectedly complex dynamics [1]. It's a testament to nature's efficiency.
Bridging the Gap
Just as adding a tail transformed early airplanes, LNNs are poised to
revolutionize AI by addressing key limitations of traditional neural networks:
1. Adaptability: LNNs adapt to new data and environments effectively [2].
2. Data Efficiency: They learn from smaller datasets, ideal for applications with
limited data [2].
3. Interpretability: LNNs offer better understanding of their decision-making
processes [2].
Promise of Fluidity
The potential applications of LNNs are vast and exciting. From enhancing
autonomous driving to revolutionizing medical diagnosis, these adaptive
networks could unlock new frontiers in AI [1]. 9
As we unravel nature's mysteries and apply them to technology, we're reminded Like
of the boundless inspiration surrounding us. Perhaps the greatest lesson from
nature is not just how to build better machines, but how to approach problems Comment
with the same flexibility, efficiency, and elegance we see in every aspect of the
natural world. Repost

I had the pleasure of being one of the distinguished speakers at the AI
International Day event organized by the National IT Academy (NITA). Speaking
on "AI Ethics in Practice" was not only interactive and fun but also incredibly
inspiring, thanks to the enthusiastic audience. I saw great potential and future
talents that will elevate the level of AI in the Eastern region, inshaAllah.
A heartfelt thank you to the Executive Director, Mr. Majed Al-Ghassab, and all
the organizers, especially Dana Aldossary, for their impeccable efforts. I'd also
like to extend my gratitude to my fellow distinguished speakers, Dr. Nora Saleh
Alturayeif, PhD and Dr. Mustafa Youldash. Your insights and contributions
made this event truly exceptional.

I know this event was a couple of months ago, but I just had to stop and be
grateful for a moment that this is my father years after early retirement.
Mahmoud Al-Hashem is the guru of technology and AI, and it does seem that I
am following (or trying to catch up!) in his footsteps. However, I just happen to
have common interests as my father, and the real secret is how he always
promoted trying, even if we would fail. It's ok. We can always get up and find
other approaches.
He worked on our mindset towards science more than technical details. He
would provide all the resources we need for the sake of learning and education.
And to be honest, his own passion in technology is just contagious, especially to
me.
One of his slogans recently with the Generative AI buzz is that "it is for
everyone", don't take age nor language as an excuse not to learn how to use it
to be more productive in your professional or even personal life. AI tools today
has made AI so accessible and so easy to use.
Thank you ByTechS for hosting this talk.

🤖 This week, I had the pleasure of attending a cutting-edge workshop on
Generative AI, hosted by the renowned AI Guru, Mahmoud Alhashem. The focus
was on harnessing the full potential of Custom Instructions and prompt
engineering—a game changer in AI applications.
🎨 The highlight was witnessing a live demo of image creation within ChatGPT
using Dall-E. It was fascinating to see how nuanced prompts can lead to
incredibly detailed and specific images, all generated through conversational AI.
💡 Plus, we dived into the world of presentation magic with AI-driven
PowerPoint plugins, transforming the way we approach slide creation.
🚀 The workshop was not just informative but also a practical guide to elevate
our AI skills. For anyone intrigued by AI’s capabilities in creative and
professional domains, this was the place to be!

After only a year of doing kickboxing and few months of Muay Thai
in REALFITNESS KSA coach Aziza Melah who officially won the title of best
Muay Thai coach in Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦 by the Saudi MuayThai Federation
It is my honor to have gotten my first medal from the Saudi Federation, a
painfully earned bronze medal. Seeing how much I've developed from zero to
being qualified to compete on a #national level only makes me excited to
continue the journey in martial arts inshaAllah.

2. Working in a talented and passionate team (Allah miraculously brought us

3. Developing an innovative idea 💡

I've started this journey of taking lectures in Industrial Psychology since March
to learn how an organization can bring the best out of its employees. It was an
eye-opening experience and a good 'start' for me in learning more in this field. I
am grateful to Allah for giving me all the resources to complete this course
(including TIME. Corona quarantine has been a positive factor for me
.personally)

I've attended many hackathons before with friends or in my company at work.
My family and I are dispersed in this pandemic, yet this is the first time I attend
.such a competition with my family
Alhamdulilah we were such a strong competent team because our fields are
relevant and diverse. The reason why I'm describing the team is to show that
we're not just family members who are working together, our great output
.was due to complementary competencies ﷲ ﻞﻀﻓ ﺪﻌﺑ alhamdulilah
It was an amazing experience and I can't thank #HopeHackathon enough for
giving us the opportunity to explore a treasure we had all along and never
!realized it before until we worked on this together

Just completed successfully a very intensive training of upstream business
operation called " Basic Petroleum Engineering for Non-Engineers". It was a
real challenge to understand all related process and the full picture from
diffrent positions such as exploration , drilling & workover, production,
maintaining potential, controlling reservoir , from onshore to offshore and
much more.
Glad to attend this training and glad that our great company #Aramco has
70 3 comments such course with expert instructor ( sikandar Gilani) who transfer his 20+
knowledge & experience in a very structure way.

#football #training #soccer #coaching Proudly announcing my latest addition to my journey in engineering, Udacity's
6-month Nanodegree as a MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER.
I will be frank, it was not easy. My background is in chemical engineering (BS)
and mechanical engineering (MS), so I was not even familiar with the
programming language. I took a couple of courses on Python in EdX, and
completed Hackerrank's 30 Days of Code challenge to practice coding in
Python. I then started my program on Machine Learning in Udacity.
The course design, content, and support from the reviewers were excellent. I
would highly recommend taking it, for anyone interested in Machine Learning
or AI!Let's get multidisciplinary. Let's be part of the future :D Solve Tutorials Code Challenges

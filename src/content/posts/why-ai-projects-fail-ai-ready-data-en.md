**Everyone wants to build AI applications right away**

In industries where decisions affect millions of dollars or critical operations, I've noticed a pattern: teams rush to launch machine learning or generative AI projects, skipping straight to the flashy end of the pipeline. But AI isn't magic, it's math on data. Too often, the data part gets ignored.

If we invested in building stronger foundations around data accessibility, quality, and integration, we could reduce so much duplicate effort and start working with better-qualified data that actually leads to sustainable AI success.

> "AI-ready data is determined by the ability to prove the fitness of data for AI use cases. AI-ready data can only be determined contextually to the use case and AI technique, which requires rethinking data management" (Edjlali, Beyer, & others, 2025).

Unfortunately, in many organizations "AI-ready" isn't even part of the conversation yet. This post isn't meant to blame anyone, but rather to gently redirect the spotlight: when we talk about AI, let's start with the data that makes it possible.

## My Call to Action

Over the next one or two years, focus more on data readiness than on building AI apps. The ROI might not be immediate, but this is a long-term investment that will prove worthwhile for many years. In the end, those who prioritize lasting infrastructure over quick wins will be the ones who actually win the race.
